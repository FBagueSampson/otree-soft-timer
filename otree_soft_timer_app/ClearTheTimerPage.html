Clearing the sessionStorage Items from the Browser

<div>
    <p style="color: blue; font-weight:bold;">
        The script on this page clears the browser's sessionStorage objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript code for removing the sessionStorage items is included in this page's HTML template. 
        The generalized code is:
        <br /><span style="font-family: monospace; font-size:11pt;"> sessionStorage.removeItem('NAME_OF_SAVED_ITEM'); </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>It is recommended that the sessionStorage objects be removed once the participants are finished with 
        each timer method.</strong> This is most reliably performed on the next un-timed page and not as a JavaScript 
        unload event. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Even though this example includes two differently behaved timers working back-to-back without the first one being formally 
        cleared from the browser before the second timer is invoked, it is generally wiser to clear one timer before beginning the
        next timer. If you must immediately follow one timeout rule with a different timeout rule, it is advisable that each timer 
        employs its own distinct name for the sessionStorage objects <span style="font-family: monospace; font-size:11pt;">'timeLeftOver'</span> 
        (the running countdown timer itself) and <span style="font-family: monospace; font-size:11pt;">'clockLeftOver'</span> 
        (the time-unit display associated with the remaining time). To do so, choose one of the pages/sections to adjust, then run 
        a find-and-replace for the names of the sessionStorage objects to be used during that part of the experiment.
